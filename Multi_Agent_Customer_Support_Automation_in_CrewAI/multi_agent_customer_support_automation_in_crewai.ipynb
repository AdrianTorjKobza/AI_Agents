            "\n",
            "To clarify, adding memory to a Crew in the context of crewAI involves composing agents that have memory capabilities. Here is a detailed explanation of how to achieve this:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Understanding Agents and Crews**: In the crewAI framework, a Crew is essentially a group of agents working together. Each agent can be customized with various tools, including memory, to perform specific tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Defining Agents with Memory**: To add memory to a Crew, you first need to define an agent that includes memory as part of its composition. This can be achieved by utilizing Pydantic models to structure your agent definitions. Pydantic allows for the creation of robust, scalable, and well-documented data models, which is ideal for defining agents with specific capabilities, such as memory.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Composition of Agents**: The composition of agents with memory involves specifying the memory component within the agent's definition. This could involve importing the necessary modules from crewAI that handle memory and then incorporating these into your agent model. For example, if crewAI provides a `Memory` class or module, you would import this and include it in your agent's composition.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Creating the Crew**: Once you have defined agents with memory, you can create a Crew by grouping these agents together. The process of creating a Crew typically involves instantiating the Crew class provided by crewAI and passing in the defined agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Example Code Snippet**: While the exact code will depend on the specifics of the crewAI API and the structure of your project, a simplified example might look something like this:\n",

            "I'd be happy to help you with setting up a Crew and kicking it off, specifically how to add memory to your Crew.\n",
            "\n",
            "To provide the best support for DeepLearningAI, I have read the website content of crewAI to find relevant information. According to the CrewAI documentation, agents can be composed with tools, memory, knowledge, and structured outputs using Pydantic. \n",
            "\n",
            "The documentation states: \"Agents: Compose agents with tools, memory, knowledge, and structured outputs using Pydantic. Includes templates and best practices.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "To add memory to a Crew in the context of crewAI, you need to compose agents that have memory capabilities. Here is a detailed explanation of how to achieve this:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Understanding Agents and Crews**: In the crewAI framework, a Crew is essentially a group of agents working together. Each agent can be customized with various tools, including memory, to perform specific tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Defining Agents with Memory**: To add memory to a Crew, you first need to define an agent that includes memory as part of its composition. This can be achieved by utilizing Pydantic models to structure your agent definitions. Pydantic allows for the creation of robust, scalable, and well-documented data models, which is ideal for defining agents with specific capabilities, such as memory.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Composition of Agents**: The composition of agents with memory involves specifying the memory component within the agent's definition. This could involve importing the necessary modules from crewAI that handle memory and then incorporating these into your agent model. For example, if crewAI provides a `Memory` class or module, you would import this and include it in your agent's composition.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Creating the Crew**: Once you have defined agents with memory, you can create a Crew by grouping these agents together. The process of creating a Crew typically involves instantiating the Crew class provided by crewAI and passing in the defined agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Example Code Snippet**: While the exact code will depend on the specifics of the crewAI API and the structure of your project, a simplified example might look something like this:\n",

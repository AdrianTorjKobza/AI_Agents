            "Neanderthals are an extinct species of human that lived in Europe and Asia from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago. They are known for their distinctive physical characteristics, including a stocky build, prominent forehead, and robust bones. Neanderthals were skilled hunters and gatherers, with a diet that consisted of meat, plants, and berries. They lived in small groups, with a social structure that was likely organized around family ties and shared resources. Noteworthy discoveries about Neanderthals include their ability to control fire, create tools, and exhibit cultural behaviors such as burial rituals and personal ornamentation.\n",

They had a complex social structure, with evidence of cooperation and shared knowledge. Neanderthals also had a deep understanding of their environment, with a diet that was adapted to their local ecosystem. Their ability to adapt to different environments and climates has been well-documented, with evidence of Neanderthal presence in a range of habitats, from forests to tundras.
